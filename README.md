Kita is a semi-opinionated fastify based typescript framework that has 0 runtime bloat
using code generation. It generates OpenAPI compliant routes, only requires functional
programming patterns, is 100% testable and supports all the usual features of fastify.

<br />

> This framework is being slowly built because one of the main goals is developer
> experience, so the API design is being carefully designed and tested by other
> developers. A fast and lightweight architecture is also one of many initial
> requirements.

<br />

```ts
// routes/hello-world.ts

export function get(name: Query = 'world') {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

```sh
# Magic happens here ðŸª„
$ kita generate
> Exporting code to src/routes.ts
```
